The term "telemetry" refers to the remote control of data (such as, for example, the brake temperature and the use of the accelerator and brake pedals) acquired by sensors placed on board the vehicle.
The data, collected by a recorder, is then sent to the team via a radio signal.
 
To get an idea of ​​the amount of data that engineers need to analyze, consider that a [Formula 1 single-seater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sR5oCIfXDI) or an [IndyCar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrgVlSQT8XM) generates 35 megabytes of data, meaning that over a whole weekend a team collects around 30 gigabytes of data .
Likewise, our cars are a source of data to which different clients (computers, smartphones and smartwatch) can connect to receive data and understand how to improve, thanks also to the graphic representations provided by the software.
The data are obviously collected in real time, which allows you to alert the pilot if there is a problem and avoid worse problems, and are also changeable, which means that we can apply some changes without having to stop the car every time .
 
As we have seen, technology plays a key role in the data collection and analysis process, but we must not forget the human component: without the skills of the engineers and the feedback from the pilots, it would be impossible to exploit the information collected to implement the most effective changes necessary to the car.
