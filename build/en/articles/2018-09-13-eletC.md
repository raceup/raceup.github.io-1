The electronic department of the *Combustion division* is a department which, although essentially "support", is of fundamental importance for the correct operation of the vehicle.

It works in close contact with all the other departments of the vehicle: one of its main tasks is in fact to manage the * sensors * mounted in the car (more than 50 sensors), which provides data and information useful for improving the car's performance.

Once collected, the data must be transmitted to the control unit by means of a light and resistant *harness*, specially designed (through 2D and 3D CAD like AutoCAD and Creo PTC) and realized in a completely autonomous manner. This wiring harnesses CAN technology to ensure fast and secure data transmission.

Once the information has been processed and interpreted to the control unit, each member of the electronic department must be able to interface with the *control unit* and with other devices in the vehicle.
The electronic department also takes care of the design (through specific CAD like KiCAD), of the simulation and finally the actual realization of several *electronic cards*, as well as their subsequent *programming* (almost all AT-MEGA microcontrollers), to ensure the correct functioning of the car.

Other important uses of the electronic department are both the programming (graphically but above all of operation) of a totally customizable *display*, which helps the driver during the driving phase by providing all the data that may be needed in a clear and visible way, both the management of the steering wheel from the electronic point of view and of all the buttons present in it.
