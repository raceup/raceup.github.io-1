The load-bearing structure of our combustion single-seater will also be built this year in a 25CrMo4 tubular steel frame welded in TIG at home. Entirely designed and produced by the team, we guarantee more than 1500 Nm / deg of torsional stiffness with less than 30 kg of chassis.

According to acquisitions on the track, we ensure a linear load transmission between the front and rear suspension system, reaching our torsion stiffness target. The 13.18 car will be even more lightweight, with the same stiffness, applying as one of the best weight / stiffness compromises between the cars of formula SAE with tubular steel!

More than 180 degrees of visibility and shadow cone less than 5 meters in front of the nose also ensure the driver to manage the car easily between the cones and an optimized geometry, the result of 12 years of experience, ensures good driving ergonomics and possibility to freely modify the suspension department, lowering the center of gravity as much as possible.
