How could our car work without it? It is a fundamental mechanical organ for all two-wheel drive cars that distributes the torque between the two drive wheels of the same axle. But why is it so important?

If all the machines were simply moving in a straight line, then the differential would have no reason to exist. However, the thrill of the curve makes the race on the track much more exciting, and of course it would not be possible without the differential.
In fact, when turning, it is necessary that the two driving wheels rotate at different speeds: the inner wheel must move at a lower speed than the external one, to avoid slipping.
This is the role of the differential, to ensure that the two wheels maintain different speeds to achieve grip in the corners.

For our combustion car we have used the limited slip differential of Drexler so far. With the first gear engaged, there is an output of 60Nm from the crankshaft which are then transformed by the transmission into 950Nm and then transferred to the wheels by the differential. Thanks to this it is possible to obtain various blocking characteristics for acceleration and braking, in order to be able to react flexibly to a wide range of driving conditions.
