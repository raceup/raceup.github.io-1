<p>This week, right after the presentation of our single-seaters on 10 May 2017, we will participate at Galileo festival: from 11 to 13 May, in Villaggio dell’Innovazione, between Palazzo del Bo and Palazzo Moroni. Along with the other excellences of University of Padua we will display our electric single-seater in a event where you will discover how the innovation grows inside of our University.</p>
