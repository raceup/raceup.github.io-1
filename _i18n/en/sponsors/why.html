<i>The encounter with Race UP students has been challenging since the first approach. A cohesive group of students coming from not only the Faculty of Engineering but also the Economics and Communication, to carry out the 360 Â° project together. The result of their steady growth is the best fruit that a sponsor can grasp!</i>

<i>For OZ Development and Research are fundamental as they are team spirit and hunger for victories that distinguish all of its collaborators. With these principles our Company supports and provides resources and work for Race UP. We know how complex it is to design a performing product and to keep alive a critical spirit, ready to identify critical issues and solutions for improvements. That is the only way to reach important goals. It is not just a training project but a training that will have a great influence on the working life of the Race UP components.</i>
