## MECSPE  2017 pt.4
**-1** **a MECSPE 2017**
Last update before MECSPE 2017, where we will be thanks to Confartigianato Padova. In this  video Marco Munaro, technical manager of electric division, explains us what happens behind the team scenes during the single-seater production. We remember you that you can find the electric single-seater in wing 7, stand C 120 during all the event.

Enjoy!
