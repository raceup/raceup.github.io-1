We are a team of more than 70 students, and we all share a passion for cars, mechanics and electronics. During the week we are normal students, on Sundays we project and build race cars. From 2006 we gather all together in a room all weeks from November to July. Our goal is to win the Formula student championship in tracks like Hockenheimring, Silverstone, Shanghai International Circuitâ€¦ The result? 11 combustion vehicles and 2 electric ones. And now a website.
