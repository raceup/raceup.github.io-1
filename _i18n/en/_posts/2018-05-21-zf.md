## ZF Race Camp 2018 recap

With other 600 students from 5 different european countries we have been invited to the **ZF Race Camp 2018**, held by ZF at the Friedrichshafen Fairground, from the 16th to the 19th of May 2018.
Thanks to this pre-event we had the possibility to meet a lot of people that share our passion and to test our brand new electric car, the **Evolution-E**, that will be unveiled this Friday, acquiring a huge quantity of data and many great advices, towards the events that we will attend this summer.

*"This event is an ideal platform for us to initiate discussions with dedicated young people,‚Äù* says **Martin Frick**, head of ZF HR Marketing. By combining a solid engineering and IT education with a passion for the emotionally charged sport of race car driving is what makes this design competition so special.
